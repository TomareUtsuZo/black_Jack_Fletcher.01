# Game Unit Initialization Analysis

## Current State

### Working Components
1. **Time System**
   - Game time advances correctly
   - Time ticks are being processed
   - Time rate control is functional

2. **Unit Factory (`UnitFactory`)**
   - Comprehensive unit templates for different ship types
   - Standardized unit creation with proper attributes
   - Support for all naval unit types (destroyers, carriers, etc.)

3. **Unit Manager (`UnitManager` in `GameStateManager`)**
   - Basic structure for managing units
   - Support for adding/removing units
   - Unit state updates during game ticks

4. **Unit Interface and Implementation**
   - Clear interface definition with required methods
   - Support for movement, detection, and combat
   - Module-based architecture for different capabilities

### Missing Components
1. **Unit Initialization**
   - No code to create initial units when game starts
   - `UnitManager.add_unit()` implementation was incomplete
   - No configuration for initial game state

2. **Unit Module Loading**
   - Units are created but modules (movement, detection, attack) aren't automatically loaded
   - No standardized module initialization process

3. **Game State Persistence** - low priority for now
   - No mechanism to save/load game state
   - Units need to be recreated on each game start

## Proposed Changes

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Unit Manager Enhancement**
   - [x] Implement `add_unit()` method
   - [ ] Add unit validation
   - [ ] Add unit removal logic

2. **Game Initialization**
   - [ ] Create initial unit setup configuration
   - [ ] Add unit creation during game start
   - [ ] Implement module loading during unit creation

3. **Testing**
   - [ ] Add tests for unit initialization
   - [ ] Add tests for module loading
   - [ ] Add integration tests for game startup

### Future Considerations
1. **Unit Templates**
   - Consider moving unit templates to configuration files
   - Add support for custom unit types
   - Add validation for unit attributes

2. **Module Management**
   - Create standard module loading process
   - Add module configuration options
   - Add module state persistence

3. **Game State Management**
   - Add save/load functionality
   - Add support for different scenarios
   - Add unit state persistence

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Unit Initialization
1. Create configuration for initial game units
2. Implement unit creation during game start
3. Add basic module loading

### Phase 2: Module Enhancement
1. Standardize module initialization
2. Add module configuration
3. Implement module state management

### Phase 3: State Management
1. Add game state persistence
2. Add scenario support
3. Add unit state saving/loading

## Technical Notes
- Unit creation should happen in `GameStateManager.start()`
- Module loading should be part of unit creation process
- Need to ensure thread safety during unit updates
- Consider adding unit validation during creation
