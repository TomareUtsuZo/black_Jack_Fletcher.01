# Test Planning Document

## Overview
This document outlines our testing strategy, focusing on behavior-driven testing that verifies functionality without coupling to implementation details. Tests are organized following our MVVM architecture.

## 1. Model Layer Tests

### Game State Tests
- **test_game_initialization**
  - Why: Ensures game starts with correct initial state


### Unit Object Tests
- **test_unit_creation**
    When units are defined.

- **test_unit_movement**
    when units are defined.
  - Why: Validates unit movement mechanics
  

- **test_unit_combat**
    when units are defined.
  - Why: Ensures combat mechanics work correctly
  - Verifies: Damage calculation, health reduction, ...


## 2. ViewModel Layer Tests

### State Transformation Tests
- **test_game_state_to_view_transformation**
  - Why: Validates data transformation for views
  - Verifies: Correct format of view data, all necessary fields present

- **test_command_handling**
    when frontend to backend commands begin to be defined.
  - Why: Ensures commands are properly processed
  - Verifies: Command validation, state updates, error handling

### WebSocket Communication Tests
- **test_websocket_state_updates**
  - Why: Validates real-time communication
  - Verifies: State broadcast, client synchronization

- **test_connection_handling**
  - Why: Ensures robust connection management
  - Verifies: Reconnection, state recovery, session management

## 3. View Layer Tests

### UI Component Tests
- **test_game_board_rendering**
    when game objects are defined.
  - Why: Ensures correct visual representation
  - Verifies: Unit placement, ocean features display, lat/long alignment

- **test_user_interaction**
    when object interaction is defined.
  - Why: Validates user input handling
  - Verifies: Click handling, drag-and-drop, keyboard shortcuts (when impliemnted)

### Visual State Tests
- **test_visual_feedback**
  - Why: Ensures clear user feedback
  - Verifies: Hover effects, selection indicators, action highlights

## 4. Integration Tests

### End-to-End Game Flow
- **test_complete_game_cycle**
    when when conditions are defined.
  - Why: Validates full game functionality
  - Verifies: Start to finish gameplay, win conditions

- **test_multiplayer_interaction**
    when multiplayer is setup.
  - Why: Ensures multiplayer functionality
  - Verifies: Player interactions, turn synchronization

### API Integration
- **test_api_endpoints**
  - Why: Validates API functionality
  - Verifies: Request/response handling, error cases

## 5. Performance Tests

### Load Testing

- **test_websocket_scalability**
  - Why: Ensures real-time communication scales
  - Verifies: Message throughput, latency under load

## 6. Security Tests

### Authentication Tests
- **test_user_authentication**
    when users are defined.
  - Why: Validates security measures
  - Verifies: Login, session management, permissions

### Input Validation
- **test_input_sanitization**
  - Why: Prevents injection attacks
  - Verifies: Input validation, error handling

## Test Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Test Structure
```python
def test_feature_behavior():
    # Given: Setup test conditions
    game = create_test_game()
    
    # When: Perform the action
    result = game.perform_action()
    
    # Then: Verify the outcome
    assert result.status == expected_status
    assert result.data == expected_data
```

### 2. Test Data Management
- Use fixtures for common test data
- Avoid hardcoded values
- Use factory patterns for test object creation

### 3. Mocking Strategy
- Mock external services
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Maintain mock fidelity to real services

## Continuous Integration
- All tests must pass before merge
- Coverage requirements: 90% minimum
- Performance test thresholds must be met

## Test Maintenance
- Review and update tests with feature changes
- Remove obsolete tests
- Keep test documentation current

---
Note: This test plan should evolve with the project. Add new test cases as features are added and update existing tests as requirements change.
