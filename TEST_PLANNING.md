## Planned Tests (To Be Implemented)

### 1. Model Layer Tests
- **Unit Object Tests**
    - When units are defined:
      - Unit creation
      - Unit movement
      - Unit combat mechanics

### 2. ViewModel Layer Tests
- **State Transformation Tests**
    - When frontend to backend commands begin to be defined:
      - Command validation
      - State updates
      - Error handling

### 3. View Layer Tests
- **Game Board Tests**
    - When game objects are defined:
      - Unit placement
      - Ocean features display
      - Lat/long alignment

- **User Interaction Tests**
    - When object interaction is defined:
      - Click handling
      - Drag-and-drop
      - Keyboard shortcuts (when implemented)

### 4. Integration Tests
- **Game Flow Tests**
    - When win conditions are defined:
      - Complete game cycle
      - Win condition verification

- **Multiplayer Tests**
    - When multiplayer is setup:
      - Player interactions
      - Turn synchronization

### 5. Authentication Tests
- **User Authentication**
    - When users are defined:
      - Login process
      - Session management
      - Permissions

## Test Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Test Structure
```python
def test_feature_behavior():
    # Given: Setup test conditions
    game = create_test_game()
    
    # When: Perform the action
    result = game.perform_action()
    
    # Then: Verify the outcome
    assert result.status == expected_status
    assert result.data == expected_data
```

### 2. Test Data Management
- Use fixtures for common test data
- Avoid hardcoded values
- Use factory patterns for test object creation

### 3. Mocking Strategy
- Mock external services
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Maintain mock fidelity to real services

## Continuous Integration
- All tests must pass before merge
- Coverage requirements: 90% minimum
- Type checking must pass
- Performance test thresholds must be met

## Test Maintenance
- Review and update tests with feature changes
- Remove obsolete tests
- Keep test documentation current

Note: This test plan evolves with the project. Tests are implemented as features are developed, following the "when defined" triggers noted in the planned tests.
